Simply put, WifiMapper helps you log wireless networks with a GPS which can be mapped and analyzed.

WifiMapper is a powerful tool. Coupled with a GPS reciever, it is very useful in finding the networks in a particular area. Run the program while driving and you can essentially find all the networks you drive by. This data can be mapped using a mapping program.

Features include:
  *Single Snapshot - Take a single reading with GPS coordinates.
  Recording Mode - Start recording! WifiMapper will scan every few seconds as you walk or drive around. Once your done, the results can be parsed and processed.
  Pinpoint device location - The more you scan an area, the more precise the location of the wireless device can be found. Eventually, you will have 99% signal strength and determining the location will be easier.

The first release will be in the fall of 2009. Email the creator for more information.
